\chapter{Introduction}

The rise of popularity and naturality of computational systems in the everyday of modern life creates the need for easy and non invasive forms of authentication. While type a hard to memorize password still is the safest approach, biometry provides an alternative with ongoing improvement. Also, speech is the most natural way humans have to communicate, being incredibly complex and with numerous specific details related to the person who produces it. Therefore, like in science fiction, it is expected an increasing of voice biometry use for actions such as authenticate in a system, command a machine and identify who is talking and the content of the conversation.

TODO dar uma breve explicação sobre biometria.

\section{Voice Recognition}

TODO explicar com mais detalhes o que é reconhecimento de voz, quais as diferenças entre reconhecimento de speech e de speaker e descrever os tipos de speaker recognition (identification e verification (tema deste trabalho))

\section{Objectives}

The objectives of this study are:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
    \item Analyse and evaluate the speaker verification system using adapted GMM proposed by Reynolds et al. \autocite{reynolds.quatieri.dunn.2000};
    \item Propose and evaluate a new method derived from GMM, using the FCM theory proposed by Gao et al. \autocite{gao.zhou.pu.2013};
    \item Conduct experiments and validation of the existent and the proposed methods.
\end{itemize}

\section{Document Structure}

Chapter 2 contains a brief historical context and some basic details about voice recognition, as well as the basic architecture for a speaker verification system. The feature extraction process is explained in chapter 3, from the reasons for its use to the chosen technique (MFCC). In chapter 4 is detailed the GMM and the UBM-GMM. Chapter 5 introduces FCM and the proposed FGMM. Experiments are described in chapter 6, as well as its results. Finally, chapter 7 concludes the study. Furthermore, this work contains an appendix with the most relevant pieces of the source code and some mathematics concepts used.
