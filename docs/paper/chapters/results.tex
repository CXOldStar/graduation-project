\chapter{Results}
\label{apx:results}

This appendix contains the results for experiments of identification using SSFGMM and verification using SSGMM and SSAGMM, due to the extensive number of tables and figures. Each experiment has its results shown in a separate section.

\section{Identification using SSFGMM}
\label{sec:results-identify-ssfgmm}

The identification using SSFGMM was performed for values 0.95, 0.99, 1, 1.01 and 1.05 of $r$. Similar to SSGMM, each value of $r$ is described by three tables and one figure.

\subsection{$r = 0.95$}
