\begin{abstract}
\begin{itshape}
The proposed project is an implementation of speaker recognition systems, both identification and verification. The systems are built using Gaussian Mixture Models, as proposed in several papers from Douglas A. Reynolds. The use of Fractional Covariance Matrix is studied as an possible increase for the traditional recognition systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Voice is a very convenient tool for human beings. We are used to communicate and command throught speech and be identified by our voices, so it is natural that the technology follow the path and become more ``vocal". From orders to a computer game to a system authentication, the knowledge of specific techniques and which is more appropriate is imperative. The first demands \textit{speech recognition} to extract information about what is said while the second uses \textit{speaker recognition} techniques to identify who is speaking through the analysis of vocal characteristics. Speaker recognition, in turn, is a major area of Computer Engineering, divided in two subfields: \textit{speaker verification}, when a speaker's claimed identity is verified, and \textit{speaker identification}, when a speaker is recognized in a group, both using the speaker's voice.

The proposed project is focused on speaker recognition and reproduces the ideas presented in \cite{reynolds.1992} and \cite{reynolds.quatieri.dunn.2000}. A secondary objective is use the theory of FCM \cite{gao.zhou.pu.2013} to try to improve the results.


\section{Objectives}
\label{ch:objectives}

The project main objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Development of a state-of-the-art speaker recognition system based on \cite{reynolds.1992} and \cite{reynolds.quatieri.dunn.2000}.
    \item Explore the theory of FCM to try to improve the system's performance, repeating the experiment from the first objective.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Schedule}
