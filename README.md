#TODO

- Diagnose the reason why the number of mixtures doesn't affect the results and correct it. One possibility is that the mixture is stucked in a local maximum.
- Generate models (GMMs and UBMs) divided in the groups presented in the database and run experiments for each one;
- Check if the values calculated for likelihoods are correct (they are very low - order of 10**-20 or less);
- Use the FCM theory.


#Corrections

- Features extracted and dividied by group, each composed by an environment (office, hallway or intersection) and a microphone mode (headset of internal).


##Dates

- Defense: March 3, 2015.
